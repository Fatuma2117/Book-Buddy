# Book Buddy Tracker

Do your children love to read? If so, is it difficult for them to keep track of all the books they’ve ever completed? The kids in my family have the same issue and I’ve come up with a solution. My app is a tool children can use to store all of the books they are currently reading or have completed in the past. This tracker allows kids to search or add all the books they are reading to a current book list. When the kid finishes their book, they are prompted to rate the book then it is added to a separate list of completed books known as the reading log. Parents have access to view and add a book to a specific kid as well as assign points to every book. The points are a reading reward system and are totaled on the child's profile page.
